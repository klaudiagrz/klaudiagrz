🧘‍♀️ Yoga – Staying grounded and mindful <br>
🇯🇵 Learning languages – Currently focusing on Japanese and Russian! <br>
📚 Reading – I’m strongly into fantasy, but I enjoy books of all genres <br>
✏️ Writing fiction – Crafting stories is my creative escape <br>
🎨 Painting – Relaxing with painting by numbers (art therapy at its finest!)
