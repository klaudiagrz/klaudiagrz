## About me

Hello, I'm Klaudia and I'm the one who docs! Both at work and in my private life. <br>

Professionally, I'm a documentation enthusiast experienced in writing both open-source and commercial docs, currently working as a Technical Writer at SAP and writing docs for the [Kyma project](https://kyma-project.io/).
Apart from being a Tech Writer, I'm also a Scrum Padawan. 

In my free time, I try my best in writing fiction.
